    <header><u>Recent News: Fallen Strike The Old Tower</u></header>

    <p>Three Guardians were recently caught searching through the Old Tower which is strictly off limits according to Vanguard policy, the discovery was that the Cryptarchs vaults had some SIVA nanites that had tests being run on them. However these guardians were attacked by fallen at their attempt to reclaim the SIVA for themselves. Luckily the guardians were prepared and have secured the place, however, the guardians now hold a dangerous relic of the past: Outbreak Perfected.
